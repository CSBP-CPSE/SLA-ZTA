The SLAZTA scripts are a set of tools used to create self-contained functional areas from commuting data. It is designed to take a set of commuting flows between areas of any type and group them into clusters eeting a user's definition for self-containment. A self-contained labour area is a territorial unit where most of the residents with jobs are working in the area and most of the jobs in the area are filled by workers residing in the area.

Developed at the Centre for Special Business Projects, this is a experimental Python port of the original code implemented in SAS to create self-contined labour areas for the non-metropolitan municipalities of Canada.

The only requirement to run the program is a commuting data file formatted as a CSV file with three columns: RES, POW, and TotalFlow. The RES and POW columns should contain a numeric code representing the origin and destination areas for the flow, while the TotalFlow column should contain the numeric value of that commuting flow.
